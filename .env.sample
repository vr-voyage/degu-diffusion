# If you're low on VRAM, uncomment the following line by

# Accapted values are fp32 and fp16
# Defaults to fp32 is not specified

# The default NUMBER OF IMAGES used in /degudiffusion form.
# Defaults to 8
#DEFAULT_IMAGES_PER_JOB=16

# Maximum number of images to output per job request.
# That means that the "NUMBER OF IMAGES" typed in /degudiffusion
# form will be clamped to that maximum value.
# Defaults to 64
#MAX_IMAGES_PER_JOB=8

# The default PROMPT used in /degudiffusion form.
# Defaults to Degu enjoys its morning coffee by {random_artists}, {random_tags}
#DEFAULT_PROMPT=A Nendoroid of Siberian Chipmunk

# The default SEED used in /degudiffusion form.
# Note that you don't have to type a SEED value, in Degu Diffusion.

# Empty by default.
#DEFAULT_SEED=-1

# Maximum number of inferences per image.

# The width and height of generated images.
# Be *EXTREMELY* careful with this one, VRAM usage grows dramatically

# I highly recommend to switch to fp16 when using more than 512x512.

# The nuber of images after which the bot will automatically create a thread.
# That means that if you set it to 2 :
# * When requesting up to 2 images per job, the bot will output everything

# Defaults to 2.
#MAX_IMAGES_BEFORE_THREAD=2

# In compact mode, the job response will only include the pictures, without

# You can still use "Check Degu PNG Metadata" in this compact mode.

# Determine if -1 should be interpreted as a random seed or an actual seed value.
# In order to mimic other Diffusers setup, -1 is now interpreted as

# That said, Degu Diffusion automatically generate random seeds, if you don't

# Force StableDiffusionPipeline to use predownloaded local files only, and avoid

# When set to true, the HUGGINGFACES_TOKEN is not required anymore.
# Defaults to false
#STABLEDIFFUSION_LOCAL_ONLY=true

# Determine where StableDiffusionPipeline download its files to.
# Mainly used for Docker setups.

# Determine the PyTorch device used. Default to "cuda".

# Maximum number of characters allowed for PROMPT in

# Note that with the default setup, StableDiffusion will

# Maximum number of characters allowed for GUIDANCE SCALE in
